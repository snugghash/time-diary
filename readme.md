##### Goal: A time tracker with intuitive, efficient UX, exportable data, completely on the client side.

## Features
* Interactive timer.
* User can observe visually how much time has elapsed. 
* Can split spent time and assign tags to blocks.
* Completely client based.
* Export data (to CSV), to be synced to other devices, imported into data analysis software, etc. 

## Workflow
1. Start tracking.
2. Visually estimate time passing.
3. Split time upon task switch.
4. Fill in description, tags via the most convenient method at the time.

## Notes
* Switching from GitHub pages (or switching subdomain in general) will refresh all your data, since this uses localStorage. Export, transport, import.

## Support, feature requests, donations
Troubleshooting support costs you based on the speed of response.
